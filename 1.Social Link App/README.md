Designed for simplicity and ease of use, it provides a quick and convenient way for visitors to connect with me across different platforms.

## My process

Building the Quotes API Server with a front-end profile HTML page involved the following key steps:

- Simple HTML structure for easy readability and maintenance.
- Custom CSS styles for a modern and responsive design.
- Each social link is represented by a distinct icon for quick recognition.
- Consistent color scheme to enhance visual coherence.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it for your needs. Happy coding!
